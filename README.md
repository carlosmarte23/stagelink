# 🎟️ StageLink

**A modern, frontend-first concert ticketing experience.**

StageLink is a React-based application designed to simulate a complete e-commerce flow for live events. While the product is a ticketing platform, the technical goal is to demonstrate **clean frontend architecture**, robust **state management**, and a seamless **UX/UI** implementation.

> **⚠️ Note:** This is a portfolio project using a mocked backend and local persistence. No real payments are processed.

## 🎨 Design & Inspiration

The UI inspired by the **Stitch design** to ensure visual consistency and accessibility.
